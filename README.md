# Stuff

A repository to store whatever it is I am learning at the time... be it code, languages, or any of the things I am interested in. 

I study by transcribing whatever I am reading, but  I will make sure to link or make a statement as to where the content is from.

### Some things you might find here eventually:

* Mathematics

* Computer Science

* Medicine

* Cryptography

* C , Go and Python

* DeFi, dApps and Smart Contracts (Perhaps even some Solidity) 

* Data Science

* Economy and Finance

* Agriculture
